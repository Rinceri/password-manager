# Python Password Manager

### Steps to use:
1. Run the `start.py` file (only first time)
2. And you're good to go! Run `main.py` everytime you want to start the password manager.

### Features
- Only the hashed form of the master password is stored in database.
- Encryption keys are derived from the master password, and hence never stored in database
- Can generate securely random passwords
