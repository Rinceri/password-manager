# Dev branch for password manager

This is currently a work in progress for a better text based user interface.

The library used for making the UI is Textual.

This currently works, however you must have a DB file already generated (which is done by running `start.py`).

To run the app, run `main.py` from root directory (that is, run `src/main.py`)

Feel free to report any bugs or additional features.
